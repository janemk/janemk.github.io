A custom made single page portfolio website.

**Tech:** HTML, CSS

Adobe Illustrator was used to make the e-mail icon and personal logo.

**Optimization:** I originally planned to make a web page for each section, but I decided a single page would be better. I wanted the sites being showcased to be the main focus. I updated the contents to be simple, direct, and easy to understand.
